A skeleton Java server to run things on the VM.

The files are in github, under coinvent/simple-server
ie. https://github.com/coinvent/coinvent/simple-server
See simple-server/install.txt

To run the server:
ssh in
screen
java -classpath web/WEB-INF/classes:web/WEB-INF/lib/* org.coinvent.SimpleServer

Then you can access it at eg.

http://148.251.85.37:8300/helloworld/helloData.json
http://148.251.85.37:8300/cmd/ls?dir=web

(these should work right now, as it is running)

To write some custom command handling, you want to copy LsServlet.java
to eg HetsServlet.java, and modify it to run your command.

Test it locally by running SimpleServer in Eclipse, and looking at
http://localhost:8300/cmd/hets

Then scp the code up into place e.g.
scp -r -P 3022 -i ~/.ssh/ewen@Coinvent-Ewen my-local-dir/simple-server
ewen@frank.soda.sh:~/simple-server

ssh in and restart the process.

Then
http://148.251.85.37:8300/cmd/hets?key=value&key2=value2
would run it.
