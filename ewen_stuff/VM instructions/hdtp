Hi,

some first version with small changes.

I had more but there are still some problems with them so here is
a version that at least:

- gives casl like output for renamings
- continously produces answers

instead of the hdtp predicate there is now a gen_simple_casl predicate

usage:
testcasl2:-load_analogy('multipletest',Analogy),disable(maprules),enable(one_to_one),gen_simple_casl(Analogy)

where multipletest was just the file with the analogy as usual.

this just does the mapping with renaming and no transfer.

when given an answer it will print true at the end.
Which is prologs way of saying there might be more answers.
If a ; character is supplied it will generate the next mapping.

The last mapping could be e.g.:

interpretation mapping: house to t =
%Cost = 12
false.

which is the empty mapping. There might be a better way to represent this.

The false here means prolog has no more answers.

gen_simple_casl(Limit,Analogy) works too where Limit is a Cost Limit number.

One thing i can add if its needed is another predicate that does not ask for a key to generate the next answer but just keeps
on generating answers until none are left anymore. Would that be useful?

Im will be employed (still have to get the contract) from 1.7 on as a researcher in osnabrueck.

Cheers,
Martin
