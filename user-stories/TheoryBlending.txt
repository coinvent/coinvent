
## User Story: We study logic

User: one of us.

Wants: to reconstruct a mathematical discovery, such as the invention of complex numbers.

Needs:

 - To specify two theories.
 - To blend them, creating a common base and blended theory.
 - To identify the unresolved questions in the blend (for complex numbers, the missing formula x.y=?).
 - To solve the unresolved questions in the blend, adding axioms and resolving any proof obligations.
 - To test the blended theory for consistency.


## User Story: Recipes


## User Story: Mechanical Engineering

User: A mechnical engineer.

Wants: To specify a new component (e.g. a car ejector seat), which has aspects of existing components.
Then get a CAD model which fits the spec.

Needs: ??


## User Story: Music Composer

User: an avante garde composer

Wants: To experiment with auto-generating music.

Needs: ??


## User Story: Fictional Animals

User: a child.

Wants: To play around creating fun new animals and interacting with them.

Needs:

 - A very friendly UI.
 - An ontology of animals behind it.
 - To specify two animals to blend.
 - To get a pictorial view of the blend.
 - To see some behaviour, e.g. robot cat chases mutant mice, stops to drink some milk, short-circuits.


## User Story: Mathematical Modelling

User: a non-mathematical analyst (e.g. someone who'd normally use Excel)

Wants: To meaningfully analyse some data using bayesian mathematical models.   
Specific example: Interpret Twitter conversational data on a topic, in terms of types of person and types of conversation.

Needs:

 - A friendly UI.
 - To create a model by blending pre-defined models.
 - To understand what they've made without understanding the source code -- i.e. a clear natural language summary of the model.
 - To apply the model to the data...
 - ...And get back results they can understand (e.g. pie-charts and time-series charts with meaningful labels).
