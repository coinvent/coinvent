Because this is a VM inside of an actual machine, you'll need to modify your SSH commands slightly.

First, copy both SSH keys into your ~/.ssh folder.

To SSH into your VM, you'll need to use the following command:

ssh -p 3022 -i ~/.ssh/ewen@Coinvent-Ewen ewen@frank.soda.sh

That should get you in.

To SCP up a directory from your local machine to the server, use eg:

scp -r -P 3022 -i ~/.ssh/ewen@Coinvent-Ewen simple-server ewen@frank.soda.sh:~/simple-server
