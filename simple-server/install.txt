# Install and Run Coinvent Integration+UI

Status: This is just a dummy Java server! It doesn't do anything (yet).

## Pre-requisites

Requires:

 - Java version 7, which should be installed on a standard Linux box.
 - Eclipse: TODO download instructions for Eclipse

## Installation

1. Compile the code in Eclipse. TODO an ant file instead, so Eclipse isn't needed.
	1. Start Eclipse
	2. Import the project:
		1. Import -> Existing project. Then select the simple-server directory
		2. You should now have a project, which will compile the code.
		3. Test: there should be sub-directories and .class files in web/WEB-INF/classes


## Run

From the coinvent/integration+UI directory:

	java -classpath web/WEB-INF/classes:web/WEB-INF/lib/* org.coinvent.web.SimpleServerMain

Then try opening these urls in your browser:

http://localhost:8300/static/hello.html
