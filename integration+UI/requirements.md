# Coinvent Requirements / User-Stories

Author: Daniel, with input from the April workshop 
Status: Draft, due for delivery in June.      
Version: 0.1   

## Overview

This document presents the motivating requirements for the integrated Coinvent system. It does so via the agile method of user-stories: each requirement is driven by an example of who needs it and why.

## User Stories

### As a Coinvent developer...

User: HETS developer    
Task: 
Use-case:    
Success criteria: 
Priority: For Year 1.

User: HDTP developer    
Task: 
Use-case:    
Success criteria: 
Priority: For Year 1.

User: Amalgams developer    
Task: 
Use-case:    
Success criteria: 
Priority: For Year 1.

User: UI developer    
Task: 
Use-case:    
Success criteria: 
Priority: For Year 1.

User: Social creativity researcher    
Task: 
Use-case:    
Success criteria: 
Priority: For Year 2/3.


### As a non-Coinvent developer...

Later in the project, we aim to run Coinvent hackathons, where other developers
use Coinvent to build things.

User: A researcher with ontology experience.   
Task: Explore concept blending.

User: A developer making a creativity tool for a domain of their choice.       
Task: 
Use-case: 
Requirements: The system must be flexible enough to support modified back-end components, and other user interfaces. Enough documentation to support 3rd party developers, including a Hello-World example project.      
Success criteria: Developers from outside the project produce projects (which may be just proof-of-concept scratch projects) using Coinvent.   
Priority: For Year 3.

### As an end-user...

#### Domain: Mathematics

User: Coinvent researcher
Task: Explore the blending of mathematical concepts.      
Use-case: Define concepts. Pick 2 concepts as input, and get back a blended concept. Further develop the blend to resolve "quality issues" such as.
Further develop the blended concept to create interesting outputs -- possibly models / examples.   
Requirements: 

1. A format which can define mathematical concepts.
3. Blend concepts to produce new concepts.
3. Weaken input concepts and strengthen output blends ??. 
4. Given a concept, check it for consistency.
4. Given a concept, produce examples / a model.

Success criteria: It works.       
Priority: High. This is the basis for all music-domain work.
 

#### Domain: Music

User: Coinvent researcher
Task: Explore the blending of musical idioms      
Use-case: Define idioms. Pick 2 musical idioms as input, and get back a blended idiom. Given an idiom, evaluate it, by creating examples and subjectively assessing them.   
Requirements: 

1. A format which can define musical idioms. Open question: What levels of structure does this have to capture?
2. Optional? The ability to statistically analyse a body of example music as part of fleshing out a musical idiom (e.g. creating an HMM for use in generation).
3. Blend idioms to produce new idioms. This requires support for weakening or otherwise resolving clashes, as fully-fledged idioms are likely to be logically inconsistent.
4. Given an idiom, produce example music.
4. Optional: Support for evaluating music / idioms.

Success criteria: It works.       
Priority: High. This is the basis for all music-domain work.
 
User: A listener
Task: Create music they like      
Use-case: Pick 2 musical idioms as input, and get back a newly-created high-quality piece of music.
Success criteria: A group is identified who adopt Coinvent-based software as part of their music listening software. Or a Coinvent-created piece of music gains small-scale public success.   
Priority: Low. This is a very hard task and may not be achieved within this project.
 
User: An avant-garde composer    
Task: Create music to use as inspiration / source material   
Use-case: Pick 2 musical idioms as input, and get back a newly-created *low-quality* piece of music.   
Success criteria: A composer collaborates with the project and uses Coinvent to create a piece of music they then perform.      
Priority: For Year 2/3. This is an achievable goal for this project.


#### Domain: Other

Domain: Fictional beasts   
User: A child    
Task: Create a fictional beast
Use-case: Pick two input beasts (using a simple user-friendly GUI), and get back a fictional blended beast with a mini-story about how it behaves.   
Success criteria: Adopted for use by a school, or distributed publicly as an app.         
Priority: For Year 2. This is an achievable goal for this project.
