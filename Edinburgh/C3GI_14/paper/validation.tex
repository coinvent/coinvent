%%% EWEN TO DO
In \S\ref{sec:technology} we showed how HETS and HDTP can be employed
to calculate generic theories and colimits. In this section we go on
to explain some mechanisms that exists to evaluate the blend -- or
colimit calculated by HETS. The criteria by which we evaluate are:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Consistency}
\item{Model Existence}
\item{Provability of key properties}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Consistency}


\subsection{Model Existence}


\subsection{Provability of key properties}

\subsection{Creativity}
